# About Browser ML Models - Tensorflow.js Repository

This repository contains the projects that I have implemented using Tensorflow.js to build and run models on a web browser, such as Google Chrome.
Each project resides in its own directory and can be run by clicking on the `.html` file included in that project folder.

## How to Run the files
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7sz6BRDYARIsAPHzrNJCc96cW15JlHefvkN_ILHzH6BEF116k-gDE70dBnfSggLoyloZ8vwaAgRrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

4. Go to [Chrome Apps](chrome://apps) and click on <b>Web Server</b>.
